    <a href="https://www.fertilizer-machine.net/solution_and_market/types-of-fertilizer.html"><h3>Types of fertilizers used in farming :</h3></a>
    <p>Fertilizers are plant nutrients that come in different types: nitrogen-based for leaf and stem growth, phosphorus-based for strong roots and flowering, potassium-based for overall plant health, and organic ones from natural sources like compost or manure. 
    They act like food supplements for plants, providing essential elements for their growth. However, it's crucial to use them carefully following instructions, as too much fertilizer can damage plants instead of helping them, akin to overfeeding someone causing harm instead of nourishment.
